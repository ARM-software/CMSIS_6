## Generate CMSIS Pack for Release

This GitHub development repository lacks pre-built libraries of various software components (RTOS, RTOS2).
In order to generate a full pack one needs to have the build environment available to build these libraries.
This causes some sort of inconvenience. Hence the pre-built libraries may be moved out into separate pack(s)
in the future.

To build a complete CMSIS pack for installation the following additional tools are required:

- **doxygen.exe**    Version: 1.9.6 (Documentation Generator)
- **mscgen.exe**     Version: 0.20  (Message Sequence Chart Converter)
- **7z.exe (7-Zip)** Version: 16.02 (File Archiver)

Using these tools, you can generate on a Windows PC:

- **CMSIS Documentation** using the shell script **gen_doc.sh** (located in ./CMSIS/Documentation/Doxygen).
- **CMSIS Software Pack** using the shell script **gen_pack.sh**.
