The branch *main* of this GitHub repository contains ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/arm-software/CMSIS_6?display_name=release&label=%20&sort=semver).

The [documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/) is available under https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_6/

Use [Issues](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_6#issues-and-labels) to provide feedback and report problems for CMSIS Version 6.

**Note:** The branch *main* of this GitHub repository reflects our current state of development and is constantly updated. It gives our users and partners contiguous access to the CMSIS development. It allows you to review the work and provide feedback or create pull requests for contributions. A [pre-built documentation](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/develop/General/html/index.html) is updated from time to time, but may be also generated using the instructions under [Generate CMSIS Pack for Release](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5#generate-cmsis-pack-for-release).

For a list of all CMSIS components refer to [**Introduction - CMSIS Components**](./CMSIS/DoxyGen/General/src/introduction.md#structure)

## Generate CMSIS Pack for Release

This GitHub development repository lacks pre-built libraries of various software components (RTOS, RTOS2).
In order to generate a full pack one needs to have the build environment available to build these libraries.
This causes some sort of inconvenience. Hence the pre-built libraries may be moved out into separate pack(s)
in the future.

To build a complete CMSIS pack for installation the following additional tools are required:

- **doxygen.exe**    Version: 1.9.2 (Documentation Generator)
- **mscgen.exe**     Version: 0.20  (Message Sequence Chart Converter)
- **7z.exe (7-Zip)** Version: 16.02 (File Archiver)

Using these tools, you can generate on a Windows PC:

- **CMSIS Documentation** using the shell script **gen_doc.sh** (located in ./CMSIS/DoxyGen).
- **CMSIS Software Pack** using the shell script **gen_pack.sh**.
