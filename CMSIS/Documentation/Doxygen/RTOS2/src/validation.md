# RTOS Validation {#rtosValidation}

The [**CMSIS-RTOS2 Validation**](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-RTOS2_Validation) framework is available to verify operation of CMSIS-RTOS2 implementations. The test cases validate the functional behavior, test invalid parameters and call management functions from Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs). The test projects are provided based on the [**CMSIS-Toolbox**](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/devtools/tree/main/tools) and integrate well into CI workflows.

For details about the scope and usage, please, refer to the [**CMSIS-RTOS2 Validation manual**](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-RTOS2_Validation/main/index.html).
