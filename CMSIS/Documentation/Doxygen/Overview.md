# Introduction {#mainpage}

The **CMSIS** (Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) is a set of APIs, software components, tools, and workflows that help to simplify software re-use, reduce the learning curve for microcontroller developers, speed-up project build and debug, and thus reduce the time to market for new applications.
