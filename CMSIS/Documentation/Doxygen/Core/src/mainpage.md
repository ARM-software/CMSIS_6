# Overview {#mainpage}

The **CMSIS-Core (Cortex-M)** component implements the basic run-time system for Arm Cortex-M devices and gives the user access to the processor core and the device peripherals.

In detail it defines:

 - **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for Cortex-M processor registers with standardized  definitions for the SysTick, NVIC, System Control Block registers, MPU registers, FPU registers, and core access functions.
 - **System exception names** to interface to system exceptions without having compatibility issues.
 - **Methods to organize header files** that makes it easy to learn new Cortex-M microcontroller products and improve software portability. This includes naming conventions for device-specific interrupts.
 - **Methods for system initialization** to be used by each MCU vendor. For example, the standardized `SystemInit()` function is essential for configuring the clock system of the device.
 - **Intrinsic functions** used to generate CPU instructions that are not supported by standard C functions.
 - A variable to determine the **system clock frequency** which simplifies the setup the SysTick timer.

**Armv8-M and Armv8.1-M Architecture**

Armv8-M introduces two profiles **baseline** (for power and area constrained applications) and **mainline** (full-featured with optional SIMD, floating-point, and co-processor extensions). Both Armv8-M profiles and Armv8.1-M are supported by CMSIS.

The Armv8-M architecture is described in the [Armv8-M Architecture Reference Manual](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0553/latest/).

The Armv8.1-M architecture further extends Armv8-M with Helium (the so called M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE)), as well as further instruction set and debug extensions.

More information about Armv8.1-M architecture is available under [Arm Helium technology](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Helium).
