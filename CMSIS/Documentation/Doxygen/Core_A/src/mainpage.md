# Overview {#mainpage}

The **CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A)** component implements the basic run-time system for a Cortex-A device and gives the user access to the processor core and the device peripherals.
In detail it defines:

 - **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** for Cortex-A processor registers with standardized  definitions for the GIC, FPU, MMU, Cache, and core access functions.
 - **System exception names** to interface to system exceptions without having compatibility issues.
 - **Methods to organize header files** that makes it easy to learn new Cortex-A microcontroller products and improve software portability. This includes naming conventions for device-specific interrupts.
 - **Methods for system initialization** to be used by each MCU vendor. For example, the standardized SystemInit() function is essential for configuring the clock system of the device.
 - **Intrinsic functions** used to generate CPU instructions that are not supported by standard C functions.
 - A variable to determine the **system clock frequency** which simplifies the setup of the system timers.

The following sections provide details about the CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A):

 - \ref using_pg describes the project setup and shows a simple program example.
 - \ref templates_pg describes the files of the CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A) in detail and explains how to adapt template files provided by Arm to silicon vendor devices.
 - \ref coreMISRA_Exceptions_pg describes the violations to the MISRA standard.
 - [**API Reference**](modules.html) describes the features and functions of the \ref device_h_pg in detail.
 - [**Data Structures**](annotated.html) describe the data structures of the \ref device_h_pg in detail.

## Access to CMSIS-Core (Cortex-A)

CMSIS-Core is actively maintained in the [**CMSIS 6 GitHub repository**](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_6) and released as part of the [**CMSIS Software Pack**](../General/cmsis_pack.html).
