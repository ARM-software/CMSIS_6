# Overview {#mainpage}

**CMSIS-Driver** specifies generic driver interfaces for peripherals commonly used in embedded systems with ArmÂ® CortexÂ® processors.

User applications and middleware components can control such peripherals using the [**CMSIS-Driver API**](modules.html) and so achieve better code reuse and simpler integration in various ecosystems. The API is designed to be generic and independent of a specific RTOS making it reusable across a wide range of supported microcontroller devices.

The following block diagram shows an exemplary set up for various drivers.

The standard CMSIS-Driver interfaces connect microcontroller peripherals with middleware that implements communication stacks, file system and graphic user interfaces.

## Benefits {#cmsis_drv_benefits}

Using CMSIS-Driver provides great benefits to the embedded developers and software vendors:

 - The CMSIS-Driver API covers \ref cmsis_drv_interfaces "many common peripherals" present in modern embedded systems for sensor interaction, data storage, communication and graphics.
 - The unified API follows the similar design principles across all peripherals. This reduces learning efforts and increases developers' productivity. See \ref theoryOperation for details.
 - Driver templates files provide code sceletons that help to get started with implementations for specific peripherals. See \ref cmsis_driver_files.
 - Support for multiple driver instances with \ref AccessStruct.
 - \ref driverValidation "Driver-Validation Suite" provides a set of tests to verify compatibility to CMSIS-Driver API definitions.

## Access to CMSIS-Driver {#cmsis_driver_pack}

CMSIS-Driver intefaces are actively maintained in the [**CMSIS 6 GitHub repository**](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_6) and released as part of the [**CMSIS Software Pack**](../General/cmsis_pack.html).

The CMSIS Software Pack publishes the API Interface under the Component Class **CMSIS Driver** with header files and a documentation. These header files are the reference for the implementation of the standardized peripheral driver interfaces.

These implementations are published typically in the Device Family Pack of a related microcontroller family under the Component Class **CMSIS Driver**. A Device Family Pack may contain additional interfaces in the Component Class **Device** to extend the standard Peripheral Drivers covered by this CMSIS-Driver specification with additional device specific interfaces for example for Memory BUS, GPIO, or DMA.

The following directories and files relevant to CMSIS-Driver are present in the **ARM::CMSIS** Pack:
