\brief    Driver API for Flash Device Interface (%Driver_Flash.h)
\details
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory" target="_blank">Flash devices</a> based on NOR memory cells are the
preferred technology for embedded applications requiring a discrete non-volatile memory device. The low read latency
characteristic of these Flash devices allow a direct code execution
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execute_in_place" target="_blank">XIP</a>) and data storage in a single memory
product.

<b>Flash API</b>

The Flash API provides a generic API suitable for Flashes with NOR memory cells independent from the actual interface
to the MCU (memory bus, SPI, ...). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Serial_flash" target="_blank">SPI</a>
flashes are typically not named NOR flashes but have usually same flash cell properties. 

The following header files define the Application Programming Interface (API) for the Flash interface:
  - \b %Driver_Flash.h : Driver API for Flash Device Interface

<b>Driver Functions</b>

The driver functions are published in the access struct as explained in \ref DriverFunctions
  - \ref ARM_DRIVER_FLASH : access struct for Flash driver functions
@{

A typical setup sequence for the driver is shown below:

<b>Example Code:</b>

/**
\struct     ARM_FLASH_SECTOR 
\details  
Specifies sector start and end address.

<b>Element of</b>:
  - \ref ARM_FLASH_INFO structure
*******************************************************************************************************************/

/**
\struct     ARM_FLASH_INFO 
\details 
Stores the characteristics of a Flash device. This includes sector layout, programming size and a default value for erased memory.
This information can be obtained from the Flash device datasheet and is used by the middleware in order to properly interact with the Flash device.

Sector layout is described by specifying the \em sector_info which points to an array of sector information (start and end address) and by specifying the \em sector_count which defines the number of sectors.
The element \em sector_size is not used in this case and needs to be \em 0.
Flash sectors need not to be aligned continuously. Gaps are allowed in the device memory space in order to reserve sectors for other usage (for example application code).

When the device has uniform sector size than the sector layout can be described by specifying the \em sector_size which defines the size of a single sector and by specifying the \em sector_count which defines the number of sectors.
The element \em sector_info is not used in this case and needs to be \em NULL.

The smallest programmable unit within a sector is specified by the \em program_unit. It defines the granularity for programming data.

Optimal programming page size is specified by the \em page_size and defines the amount of data that should be programmed in one step to achieve maximum programming speed.

Contents of erased memory is specified by the \em erased_value and is typically \em 0xFF. This value can be used before erasing a sector to check if the sector is blank and erase can be skipped.

/**
\struct     ARM_DRIVER_FLASH
\details 
The functions of the Flash driver are accessed by function pointers exposed by this structure. Refer to \ref DriverFunctions for overview information.

Each instance of a Flash interface provides such an access structure. 
The instance is identified by a postfix number in the symbol name of the access structure, for example:
 - \b Driver_Flash0 is the name of the access struct of the first instance (no. 0).
 - \b Driver_Flash1 is the name of the access struct of the second instance (no. 1).

A middleware configuration setting allows connecting the middleware to a specific driver instance \b %Driver_Flash<i>n</i>.
The default is \token{0}, which connects a middleware to the first instance of a driver.
*******************************************************************************************************************/

/**
\struct     ARM_FLASH_CAPABILITIES 
\details
A Flash driver can be implemented with different capabilities. The data fields of this struct encode 
the capabilities implemented by this driver.

The element \em event_ready indicates that the driver is able to generate the \ref ARM_FLASH_EVENT_READY event. In case that this event is not available it is possible to poll the driver status by calling the \ref ARM_Flash_GetStatus and check the \em busy flag.

The element \em data_width specifies the data access size and also defines the data type (uint8_t, uint16_t or uint32_t) for the \em data parameter in \ref ARM_Flash_ReadData and \ref ARM_Flash_ProgramData functions.

The element \em erase_chip specifies that the \ref ARM_Flash_EraseChip function is supported. Typically full chip erase is much faster than erasing the whole device sector per sector.

\fn void ARM_Flash_SignalEvent (uint32_t event)
\details

The function \b ARM_Flash_SignalEvent is a callback function registered by the function \ref ARM_Flash_Initialize. 
The function is called automatically after read/program/erase operation completes.

The parameter \em event indicates one or more events that occurred during driver operation. Each event is coded in a separate bit and
therefore it is possible to signal multiple events in the event call back function. 

Not every event is necessarily generated by the driver. This depends on the implemented capabilities stored in the 
data fields of the structure \ref ARM_FLASH_CAPABILITIES, which can be retrieved with the function \ref ARM_Flash_GetCapabilities.

The following events can be generated:

Parameter \em event                 | Bit | Description 
:-----------------------------------|:---:|:-----------
\ref ARM_FLASH_EVENT_READY          |  0  | Occurs after read/program/erase operation completes.
\ref ARM_FLASH_EVENT_ERROR          |  1  | Occurs together with \ref ARM_FLASH_EVENT_READY when operation completes with errors.
